                    <h2>Background <span>⚛️</span></h2>
                    <p>My name is Tin, and I am currently a second-year physics major at Skyline College. My passion for physics began at the age of 10 when I started exploring the question of what I wanted to do when I grew older. One day, I took apart a remote-controlled helicopter to see what was inside. My father joined me in this journey, explaining how infrared light controlled the helicopter.</p>
					<p>My journey in physics has been like a non-periodic sinusoidal wave, both exciting and frustrating. At one point, I lost interest in physics because it felt like I was only solving equations. In high school, I considered becoming an electrical engineer because I was drawn to applied physics, particularly in integrated circuits, which I found both magical and rewarding to work with. At the same time, I struggled to understand the concept of simple harmonic motion in my physics class.</p>
					<p>Everything changed when I discovered The Feynman Lectures on Physics on Reddit. Feynman’s humor and his famous teaching style helped me see the beauty behind the formulas and reignited my appreciation for physics. Later, in my third semester of college, I learned about Maxwell’s wave equations, where I realized I will commit to physics.</p>


                    <h2>Intrests <span>⚛️</span></h2>
					<p>I have a strong interest in optics, particularly because it connects to the principles of electricity and magnetism. My interest in optics began when I realized that I could calculate the polarization of light using the electric dipole moment formula.</p>
					<p>I have worked on various optics-related projects, including working with PMTs, photodiodes, SIPMs, and radio telescopes. I also experimented with creating my own photodiode. Additionally, I have a very solid understanding of electronics and programming, both of which are crucial in the field of optics. Currently, I am still exploring the various options and opportunities within optics.</p>


                    <h2>Moving Forward <span>⚛️</span></h2>
                    <p> I see myself as an experimental physicist either working in research or industry</p>
